## Deploying Containerized Applications with AWS ECS

The DevOps team is working on automating the deployment of a containerized Flask application using AWS services like ECR, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, ECS and a Load Balancer. The goal of this task is to set up a continuous delivery pipeline that builds a Docker image, pushes it to ECR, and deploys the application to an ECS cluster.

1. Create an ECR repository named xfusion-ecr-repo for storing Docker images.
2. Create a CodeCommit repository named xfusion-code-repo to store the Python Flask application's source code, the source code is available on AWS client host under /root/pyapp directory. 
3. Configure SSH Git Credentials so that you can push the changes to this repo from the AWS Client Host. You may need to create an SSH key pair on AWS Client Host.

```
# On AWS Client Host
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -C "codecommit-key"
aws iam upload-ssh-public-key --user-name <your-iam-user> --ssh-public-key-body file://~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

4. Create an ECS cluster named xfusion-ecs-cluster, a service named xfusion-ecs-service and a task definition named xfusion-ecs-task. 
    - configure it to use an application load balancer named xfusion-ecs-alb along with a target group named xfusion-ecs-tg so that the application can be accessible via the Load Balancer's DNS URL.
5. Set up a CodeBuild named xfusion-build-project and a CodePipeline named xfusion-pipeline with three stages: Source, Build, and Deploy. 
    - The Source stage must pull the source code from CodeCommit
    - the Build stage must build the Docker image and push it to the ECR repo
    - the Deploy stage must deploy the newly built image to the ECS cluster
